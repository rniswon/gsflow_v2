GSFLOW version 2.3.1 is packaged for personal computers using one of the Linux or 
Microsoft Windows operating systems. An executable file compiled for 64-bit operating 
systems is provided. The Linux executable was compiled using the gfortran and gcc
compilers (8.3.0 version). The Windows executable was compiled using the Microsoft
Visual Studio Community 2019, Version 16.3.7 and the Intel Parallel Studio XE 2019
Update 5 Composer Edition and Microsoft Visual C++ 2019 compilers.

The source code and Linux Makefiles are provided to aid users in compilation
on other computers. However, no support is provided for compilation.

IMPORTANT: Users should review the file 'GSFLOW_Release_Notes_2.3.1.pdf' for a 
description of, and references for, this software. Changes that have been 
introduced into GSFLOW with each official release also are described in this 
file; these changes may substantially affect users.

Instructions for installation, execution, and testing of this version of
GSFLOW are provided below.

A. DISTRIBUTION FILE

The following distribution files are for use on personal computers:

         gsflow_2.3.1.zip for Windows-based personal computers
         gsflow_2.3.1_linux.zip for Linux-based personal computers

The distribution file contains:

          Executable and source code for GSFLOW.
          GSFLOW documentation.
          Related documentation for PRMS and MODFLOW.
          Seven GSFLOW example problems.
          An Excel spreadsheet for analysis of GSFLOW water-budget results.

Unzipping the distribution file creates numerous individual files contained in 
several subdirectories. The following directory structure will be created in the 
installation directory:

   |
   |--gsflow_2.3.1       ; Release notes and Readme
   |    |--bin           ; Compiled GSFLOW executable for personal computers
   |    |--data          ; Nine example GSFLOW application models described
                           in USGS reports.
   |    |--doc           ; Documentation reports for GSFLOW and related
                           software.
            |--Related reports	; Additional reports and information files
   |    |--src
   |        |--gsflow           ; Source code for GSFLOW Modules
   |        |--mmf              ; Source code for MMF software
   |        |--modflow          ; Source code for MODFLOW 
                                  Packages
   |        |--prms             ; Source code for PRMS Modules
   |        |--merge			; Source code for utility program to merge restart files
   |    |--water-budget utility ; Utility program for analysis of GSFLOW output


It is recommended that no user files be kept in the gsflow_2.3.1 directory
structure.  If you do plan to put your own files in the directory structure, 
do so only by creating additional subdirectories of the "data" subdirectory.

Included with the release are several documents that use the Portable Document 
Format (PDF) file structure. The PDF files are readable and printable on various 
computer platforms using Acrobat Reader from Adobe. The Acrobat Reader is freely 
available from the following World Wide Web site: http://www.adobe.com/


B. INSTALLING

To make the executable version of GSFLOW accessible from any directory, the 
directory containing the executable (gsflow_2.3.1_linux/bin on Linux-based computers or 
gsflow_2.3.1\bin on Windows-based computers) should be included in the PATH
environment variable. Also, if a prior release of GSFLOW is installed on your 
system, the directory containing the executable for the prior release should be 
removed from the PATH environment variable.

As an alternative, the executable file in the "bin" subdirectory can be copied 
into a directory already included in the PATH environment variable. Note, the example 
problems provided with the release (described below) have example Linux shell script or
Windows batch files that require the executable be in the "bin" subdirectory.


C. EXECUTING THE SOFTWARE

A 64-bit (gsflow for Linux or gsflow.exe for Windows) executable is provided in the "bin" 
subdirectory. After the "bin" subdirectory is included in your PATH, GSFLOW is 
initiated in a Command-Prompt window using the command:

      gsflow [Fname]

The optional Fname argument is the name of the GSFLOW Control File.  If no argument is used,
then GSFLOW will look for a Control File named "control" in the user's current directory.

The arrays in GSFLOW are dynamically allocated, so models are not limited
by the size of input data. However, it is best to have at least 4 MB of 
random-access memory (RAM) for model execution and more RAM for large models.
If there is less available RAM than the model requires, which depends
on the size of the application, the program will use virtual memory; however,
this can slow execution significantly. If there is insufficient memory to 
run the model, then GSFLOW will not initiate the beginning of the simulation; 
however, if on a Windows-based computer, the Command-Prompt window may continue 
to indicate that GSFLOW is executing. For this circumstance, the program must be 
terminated manually using the Windows Task Manager application.

Some of the files written by GSFLOW are unformatted files. The structure
of these files depends on the compiler and options in the code. GSFLOW is compiled 
with the unformatted file type specified as "UNFORMATTED". Any program that reads the 
unformatted files produced by GSFLOW must be compiled with a compiler that produces
programs that use the same structure for unformatted files.  For example, Zonebudget and
Modpath use unformatted budget files produced by the MODFLOW component of GSFLOW.
Another example are head files that are generated by one GSFLOW simulation and used
in a following simulation as initial heads. Both simulations must be run using
an executable version of GSFLOW that uses the same unformatted file structure.


D. TESTING

Nine sample problems with GSFLOW data sets are provided in the "data" subdirectory
to verify that GSFLOW is correctly installed and running on the user's system.
The sample problems also may be looked at as examples of how to use the program. 
See the 'Readme.txt' file in that subdirectory for a description of the sample problems.


E. COMPILING

The executable file provided in distribution was created using compilers as described
above. Although executable versions of the program are provided, the source code also
is provided in the "src" subdirectory so that GSFLOW can be recompiled if necessary.
However, the USGS cannot provide assistance to those compiling GSFLOW. In general, the 
requirements are a Fortran compiler, a compatible C compiler, and the knowledge
of using the compilers. Makefiles are included in the "src" subdirectories as an example
for compiling GSFLOW.
