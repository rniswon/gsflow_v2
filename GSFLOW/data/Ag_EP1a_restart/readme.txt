Test problem 1a for Ag Package
Example problem 1a simulates irrigation water supplied by surface water and supplemented by groundwater in a MODFLOW simulation modified from Test 1 in Prudic et al. (2004)
Simulation used the AG Package with the ETDEMAND option
The test is run with low and high stream inflow hydrographs
