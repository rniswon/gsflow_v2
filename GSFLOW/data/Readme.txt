                                 August 2015
 
Three sample problems with GSFLOW data sets are provided in this subdirectory
to verify that GSFLOW is correctly installed and running on the user's system.
The sample problems also may be looked at as examples of how to use the 
program. 

Sample problems:

1. sagehen: This sample GSFLOW model is for the Sagehen Creek Watershed and 
is described in the original GSFLOW documentation (Markstrom and others, 2008,
USGS TM 6-D1).

2. sagehen_restart: This sample is also for the Sagehen Creek Watershed and 
demonstrates use of the GSFLOW restart option. The problem is described in
Regan and others (2015, USGS TM 6-D3).

3. tahoe_restart: This sample GSFLOW model is for the Lake Tahoe watershed
and demonstrates use of the GSFLOW restart option. The problem is described
in Regan and others (2015, USGS TM 6-D3).
